## Story

> GIVEN a functional Express.js API

> WHEN I add my database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file
> THEN I am able to connect to a database using Sequelize

> WHEN I enter schema and seed commands
> THEN a development database is created and is seeded with test data

> WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
> THEN my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to 
the MySQL database

> WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia Core for categories, products, or tags
> THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON

> WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia Core
> THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database
